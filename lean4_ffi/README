This is some sample code that uses the LLVM API from a Lean program.

The purpose of the program is just to test feasiblity.  All the
program does is load a bitcode file, print out the module name, and
then set the module name to verify that could be done.

The only change made to Lean was to drop the static qualifier from
REAL_WORLD in `io.cpp`, but that probably isn't strictly necessary.

For further details, the following files may be of interest:

dump_llvm.lean: Contains all the lean code in the same program
llvm_exports.cpp: Contains all the C++ code
build.sh: A bash script for building the C++ and Lean code.
